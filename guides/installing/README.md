# OpenProject Installation Guides


## Packages

We strongly suggest installing OpenProject using our RPM/Deb packages.
The packages provide a fast and reliable method to get started with OpenProject, as well as upgrading your installation to the latest version.

Get started with installing and upgrading OpenProject using [our Installation Guide starting point](https://www.openproject.org/open-source/download/).

## Docker Images

We provide Docker images for the OpenProject Community Edition. Please see [this guide](./docker/README.md) for more information.


## Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up OpenProject from source, please use the [manual installation guide](./manual/README.md) for a step-by-step guide to complete your installation. Please do note that OpenProject requires an extensive set of dependencies and we highly recommend to choose either the installation package or the docker image instead.
